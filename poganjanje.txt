Device registering and binding

All you have to do is to copy the deviceId you got in the log, and use it in these commands that you'll have to run from the blockchain folder:

// register a new device
npx hardhat register-device --deviceid <YOUR_DEVICE_ID> --network testnet

// bind a device with an owner
npx hardhat bind-device --deviceid <YOUR_DEVICE_ID> --userid <YOUR_ADDRESS> --network testnet
Run the npm start command again to start sending messages to your project. To visualize your new token rewards, simply import the token address in your metamask wallet, and make sure you're on the IoTeX Testnet.
