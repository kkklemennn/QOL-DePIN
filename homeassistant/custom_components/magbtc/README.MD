### Explanation
Directory Structure: Create the necessary files and directories as shown.
manifest.json: Defines the component metadata.
init.py: Sets up the component.
const.py: Contains constants used in the component.
config_flow.py: Manages the configuration flow for the component, allowing users to set it up via the Home Assistant UI.
sensor.py: Defines a sensor entity that fetches data from your API.
translations/en.json: Provides translations for the configuration flow.

### Testing the Component
Restart Home Assistant: Restart Home Assistant to load the new custom component (ha core restart)
Add the Integration: Go to Configuration -> Integrations -> Add Integration and search for "MagBTC".
Configure the Integration: Enter the API URL when prompted.

Restarting the core after modifying the code:
ha core restart


### How it works:
Arduino Code:

Setup: In the setup() function, the Arduino connects to the Wi-Fi network and starts the HTTP server.
Loop: In the loop() function, the Arduino continuously checks for incoming client connections.
Client Handling: When a client connects, the Arduino reads the HTTP request. If it's a request for /sensor-data, it reads the sensor value and sends it back as the HTTP response.
Home Assistant Integration:

Config Flow: During the initial setup, the user inputs the IP address of the Arduino device.
Sensor Entity: The MagBTCSensor entity in Home Assistant is created with the provided IP address and an update interval.
Periodic Updates: Using the async_track_time_interval function, Home Assistant schedules periodic updates to fetch new data from the Arduino.
Example Interaction
Initial Setup:

User configures the integration in Home Assistant with the Arduino's IP address.
Home Assistant starts periodically sending HTTP GET requests to the Arduino.
Periodic Data Request:

Every 60 seconds (or the configured interval), Home Assistant sends an HTTP GET request to http://<arduino_ip>/sensor-data.
Arduino receives the request, reads the sensor value (e.g., from analogRead(A0)), and sends it back in the HTTP response.
State Update:

Home Assistant receives the HTTP response containing the sensor value.
The state of the MagBTCSensor entity in Home Assistant is updated with the new sensor value.
