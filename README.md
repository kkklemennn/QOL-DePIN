# IoTeX based secure air monitoring DePIN

My Master's Thesis project is proposed optimal solution for integrating blockchain technology with lightweight devices such as IoT sensors and mobile platforms. This project leverages IoTeX blockchain technology and the W3bstream platform to ensure data integrity, security, and efficiency in air quality monitoring. Additionally, it incorporates a simple economic model where users are rewarded with tokens for their contributions, fostering greater participation and network growth. The scalability and network effect ensure that as more users join, the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) becomes more valuable and effective. The project is organized into the following components:

## Directory overview

### applet

### arduino
The Arduino directory contains the comprehensive code for developing and deploying a secure air monitoring sensor. It includes individual functionality tests, utility scripts for tasks such as key generation and Wi-Fi scanning, and the integrated production code for the sensor. This setup enables the sensor to read data, manage connections, and securely communicate with W3bstream and HomeAssistant.
