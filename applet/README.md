# applet
This directory is structured to facilitate the development, testing and deployment of our secure air monitoring WebAssembly (WASM) applet which runs on the W3bstream platform.

The source code in `assembly` directory implements the applet's functionality.

The `build` directory holds the compiled outputs.

The`node_modules` directory contains the project's dependencies.

The configuration files set up the AssemblyScript environment and testing framework.

### asconfig.json
Configuration file for AssemblyScript, defining compiler options and project settings.

### package.json
Manages project dependencies and scripts for building, testing and running the applet.

### package-lock.json
Locks the versions of dependencies to ensure consistent build across different environments.
